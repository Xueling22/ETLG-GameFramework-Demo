			<statement>· Cybersecurity helps minimize crime and harm in the virtual world. Think of it as a set of techniques to protect the secrecy, integrity, and availability of computer systems and data against threats.&#xA;· Authentication refers to the process by which a computer understands who it is interacting with. There are three types of authentication: what you know, what you have, and what you are.&#xA;· Often, security experts suggest using two or more forms of authentication (two-factor or multi-factor authentication) for important accounts.&#xA;· Permissions or Access Control Lists (ACLs) describe the access each user has to view or modify any file, folder, or program on a computer.&#xA;· Malicious software called malware can make a program or computing system vulnerable to attacks that copy user data and allow hackers to disguise as the user.</statement>
