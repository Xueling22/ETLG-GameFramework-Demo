			<statement>· The most common forms of computer security are known as cryptography. System architects employ these strategies to make information secret to frustrate attackers.&#xA;· A cipher is an algorithm that converts plain text into ciphertext, which is nonsense unless you have a key that lets you undo the cipher. The process of making text secret is called encryption, and the reverse process is called decryption.&#xA;· Cryptographic techniques rely on keys that are known by both the sender and recipient. The sender encrypts a message using a key, and the recipient decrypts it using the same key.&#xA;· Key exchange uses an algorithm that lets two computers agree on a key without ever sending one, using one-way functions (mathematical operations) that are easy to do in one direction, but hard to reverse.&#xA;· Keys that can be used by both sender and receiver, to encrypt and decrypt messages, are called symmetric keys because the key is the same on both sides.&#xA;· Asymmetric encryption uses two different keys, most often one that is public and another that’s private. Senders can encrypt a message using a public key that only the recipient, with their private key, can decrypt.</statement>
